## What
A very fast website copy script using a cuckoo hash table & xxhash & DAG. There are still many problems.
I feel sad about disappearing websites, and Iâ€™m thinking of ways to save them even faster.  
  
*Websites are our memories.*  
Let everyone rise up and preserve disappearing historical websites, leaving them for the future.  
For all geeks and for those who love the internet. If you find an interesting website, please contact me.  
  
Furthermore, with the `-w` option, you can set higher priorities based on the URL. I don't think other website mirroring software has this feature.
  
Collisions are avoided by the cuckoo hash table and generated by the ultra-fast xxhash.
It consists of xxh32 and xxh64 as different hash values.

## Install
deps
```
curl https://pyenv.run | bash

pyenv install 3.12.3
pyenv virtualenv 3.12.3 ck
pyenv activate ck

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can build the CuckooHashtables implemented in Rust and install it using pip. This will allow you to call it from your Python code. If you prefer not to install it globally, you can also install it from within a virtual environment.
```
maturin build
pip install target/wheels/your_package_name.whl

chmod +x main.py
```
or
```
pip install target/wheels/your_package_name.whl --force-reinstall

chmod +x main.py
```

## Usage
```
$ python3 main.py -h
usage: main.py [-h] [-c CONNECTIONS] [-w WEIGHTS [WEIGHTS ...]] [-v EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]] [-f] url output_dir

Mirrors a website.

positional arguments:
  url                   URL of the website to mirror
  output_dir            Directory to save the mirrored files

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c, --connections CONNECTIONS
                        Number of simultaneous connections (default: 50)
  -w, --weights WEIGHTS [WEIGHTS ...]
                        Strings to set URL priorities (can specify multiple separated by spaces)
  -v, --exclude EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]
                        URL patterns to exclude (can specify multiple separated by spaces)
  -f, --force           Force re-download even if the download was already completed
```
